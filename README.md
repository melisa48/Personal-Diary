# Diary Application

This simple diary application allows users to create daily directories and save entries for each day. It is built using Python and the tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Create Daily Directories:** The application automatically creates a directory for each day if it doesn't already exist.

- **Save Entries:** Users can type their diary entries in a text box and save them. Each entry is saved in a separate text file within the corresponding daily directory.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface with a text entry box, save button, and quit button.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    python diary_app.py
    ```

2. The application window will appear, featuring a text entry box to type your diary entries.

3. Click the "Save" button to save your entry. The application will create a daily directory (if not already created) and save the entry as a text file within that directory.

4. Click the "Quit" button to close the application.
